**by Ken Kai** 👨‍💻

Tired of wrestling with MCP server setup and confusing docs? Yeah, me too. This course gets you from zero to published NPM package in minutes, not hours.

## 🎯 What You Get

This isn't just another code repo - it's a **complete learning system**:

- ✅ **Working calculator example** (`/mcp-calculator/`) - Copy, tweak, ship
- ✅ **Step-by-step docs** (`/docs/`) - No guesswork, just follow along
- ✅ **NPM publishing workflow** - From code to Claude-ready in one command
- ✅ **Beautiful response formatting** - Make your tools look professional
- ✅ **Local testing setup** - Test before you deploy
- ✅ **Troubleshooting guide** - When things go wrong (they will)

## 🚀 Get Started

**1. Use this template:**
```bash
# Use GitHub's template feature or download/copy the files
# Then navigate to your new project
cd your-mcp-project
```

**2. Check out the working example:**
```bash
cd mcp-calculator
npm install
npm run build
npm run inspector  # Opens MCP testing tool
```

**3. Actually read the docs (they're good, promise):**
- Start with [`docs/mcp-basics.md`](./docs/mcp-basics.md) - Learn MCP concepts
- Then [`docs/project-structure.md`](./docs/project-structure.md) - Copy-paste templates
- Finally [`docs/npm-setup.md`](./docs/npm-setup.md) - Publish to NPM

## 💪 What Makes This Different

### New to MCP?
- **No BS** - I explain everything, no assumed knowledge
- **Working code** - Copy, tweak, ship. Done.
- **Real problems** - I've hit every wall so you don't have to

### Already know your stuff?
- **Best practices built-in** - TypeScript, validation, proper error handling
- **Production patterns** - This scales from toy project to real tool
- **Skip the research** - Just get building
